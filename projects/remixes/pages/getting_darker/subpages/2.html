   <h1>Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening</h1>

   <p>
   Whose woods these are I think I know.<br>
   His house is in the village though;  <br>
   He will not see me stopping here<br>
   To watch his woods fill up with snow.
 </p>

 <p>
   My little horse must think it queer<br>
   To stop without a farmhouse near<br>
   Between the woods and frozen lake<br>
   The darkest evening of the year.
 </p>

 <p>
   He gives his harness bells a shake<br>
   To ask if there is some mistake.<br>
   The only other soundâ€™s the sweep<br>
   Of easy wind and downy flake.
 </p>

 <p>
   The woods are lovely, dark and deep,<br>
   But I have promises to keep,<br>
   <span><font color="#808080">And miles to go before I sleep,<br>
   And miles to go before I sleep.</font></span>

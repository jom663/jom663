  <h1>Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening</h1>
  
  <p class="white">
  Whose woods these are I think I know.<br>
  His house is in the village though;<br>
  He will not see me stopping here<br>
  To watch his woods fill up with snow.
</p>

<p class="white">
  My little horse must think it queer<br>
  To stop without a farmhouse near<br>
  Between the woods and frozen lake<br>
  The darkest evening of the year.
</p>

<p class="white">
  He gives his harness bells a shake<br>
  To ask if there is some mistake.<br>
  The only other soundâ€™s the sweep<br>
  Of easy wind and downy flake.
</p>

<p class="flick">
  The woods are lovely, dark and deep,<br>
  But I have promises to keep,<br>
  And miles to go before I sleep,<br>
  And miles to go before I sleep.
</p>

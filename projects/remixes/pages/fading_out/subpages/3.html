  <h1 class="white">Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening</h1>
  
<p>
    Whose woods these are <span class="white">I think I know.</span><br>
    His house is in the village though;<br>
    He will <span class="white">not see</span> me stopping here<br>
    To watch his woods fill up with <span class="white">snow.</span>
</p>

<p>
    My little horse must think it queer<br>
    <span class="white">To stop</span> without a farmhouse <span class="white">near</span><br>
    Between the woods and <span class="white">frozen lake</span><br>
    The <span class="white">darkest</span> evening of the year.
</p>

<p>
    He gives his <span class="blur">harness</span> bells a shake<br>
    To ask if there is <span class="blur">some mistake.</span><br>
    <span class="blur">The only other sound</span>â€™s the sweep<br>
    Of easy wind and downy <span class="blur">flake.</span>
</p>

<p>
  The woods are lovely, dark and deep,<br>
  But I have promises to keep,<br>
  And miles to go before I sleep,<br>
  And miles to go before I sleep.
</p>

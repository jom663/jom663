  <h1 class="white">Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening</h1>
  
  <p>
    Whose woods these are <span class="blur">I think I know.</span><br>
      His house is in the village though;<br>
      He will <span class="blur">not see</span> me stopping here<br>
      To watch his woods fill up with <span class="blur">snow.</span>
</p>

<p>
  My little horse must think it queer<br>
  To stop without a farmhouse near<br>
  Between the woods and frozen lake<br>
  The darkest evening of the year.
</p>

<p>
  He gives his harness bells a shake<br>
  To ask if there is some mistake.<br>
  The only other soundâ€™s the sweep<br>
  Of easy wind and downy flake.
</p>

<p>
  The woods are lovely, dark and deep,<br>
  But I have promises to keep,<br>
  And miles to go before I sleep,<br>
  And miles to go before I sleep.
</p>

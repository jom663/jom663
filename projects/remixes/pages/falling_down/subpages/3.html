    Whose woods these are <span class="fall">I think I know.</span><span class="white">I think I know.</span><br>
    His house is in the village though;<br>
    He will <span class="fall">not see</span><span class="white">not see</span> me stopping here<br>
    To watch his woods fill up with <span class="fall"></span><span class="white">snow.</span>

<p>
    My little horse must think it queer<br>
    <span class="fall">To stop</span><span class="white">To stop</span> without a farmhouse <span class="fall">near</span><span class="white">near</span><br>
    Between the woods and <span class="fall">frozen lake</span><span class="white">frozen lake</span><br>
    The <span class="fall">darkest</span><span class="white">darkest</span> evening of the year.

    To ask if there is <span class="fall">some mistake.</span><span class="white">some mistake.</span><br>
    <span class="fall">The only other sound</span><span class="white">The only other sound</span>â€™s the sweep<br>

  But I have promises to keep,<br>
  And miles to go before I sleep,<br>
  And miles to go before I sleep.
